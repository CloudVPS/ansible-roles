# Roles
The Roles repository contains all [Ansible roles](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_roles.html) that are developed by CloudVPS to install and manage servers and clusters. A variety of roles are available, all with focus on a single application or component.

# Usage

Every folder in this repository is a separete role, and can be configured in your ansible config by pointing the roles_path to this git repo.

Details on how to use individual roles can be found in the individual readme files.
