# Roles
The Roles repository contains all [Ansible roles](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_roles.html) that are developed by CloudVPS to install and manage servers and clusters. A variety of roles are available, all with focus on a single application or component.


# Usage

Every folder in this repository is a separete role, and can be configured in your ansible config by pointing the roles_path to this git repo.

Details on how to use individual roles can be found in the individual readme files.


Please keep in mind that CloudVPS offers no support on these roles.
We will however accept valid pull requests in order to keep the roles up to date.
